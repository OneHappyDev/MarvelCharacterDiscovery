Marvel Discovery

A SwiftUI app for tvOS to allow you to go deeper into the Marvel Universe.  Discover New Characters and Comics to find your next read

# To Run
Insert BOTH your Public and Private Keys in the APIInformation.swift file (variables public/private key)

# Implementation Details
Views require an Observable Object that will handle data fetching (view model)
View Models using Combine and Services (MavelDataFetching) is using async/await to run the urlRequests
There are Previews enabled using Mock Services (json from bundle).  This helps iteration on the SwiftUI pieces
View Models have an injectable API layer an scheduler to all unit tests to inject whatever they need with a mock

# To Optimize to make a real app
- Paging of the API responses.   The current services will only provide the first of the values and I'm okay with that for this iteration.
- See the serialized responses for total, offset, limit, and count.  We'd need to fetch next pages.
- Optimizing the UX.  I didn't spend much time futzing about here
- Handle the API Errors.   The View Model is testing that it stops loading and has data but doesn't REALLY report back any meaningful information to the user
